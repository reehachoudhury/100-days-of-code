I've joined the 100 days of coding challenge! I will be attempting for the next one hundred days to code for at least an hour a day! 

Day 1: Monday 12th February

Completed fCC responsive web design - will need more practice using HTML/CSS. Aim to develop this with further projects. 
Started JavaScript Algorythms and Data Structures (Beta) Certification, I have previously done the fundamentals section on the archived version of this certification but this was a good bridge between HTML/CSS into JS.
Began week 2 of SoC.
